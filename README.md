### 3. Finding objects in MS SQL
  Brief: this script will help to find sql objects like tables, SPs, UDFs and columns in a database/server by exact name or certain keyword in definition or name. The script will          be devided into parts to  make it ease by object type
         Each above part will be further sub-divided as to search with exact name or a keyword in Name or definition.
         part 1 : Table
         part 2 : SPs
         part 3 : columns
         part 4 : UDFs
